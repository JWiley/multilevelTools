\title{merMod method for R2}
\usage{
\method{R2}{merMod}(object, cluster = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A model estimated by \code{lmer}.}

\item{cluster}{A logical whether to calculate individual pseudo R2 values by
cluster unit (if \code{TRUE}) or the marginal and conditional R2 for the
overall model (if \code{FALSE}, the default).}

\item{...}{Added for consistency with generic. Not currently used.}
}
\value{
a named vector with the marginal and conditional R2 values,
  if \code{CLUSTER = FALSE}, otherwise, a data table with the pseudo R2
  for each cluster unit.
}
\description{
For pseudo R2 by cluster, the squared correlation between observed
and predicted values for each cluster unit is returned.  For the overall model,
the marginal and conditional R2 are calculated as described in the references.
}

\dontrun{
data(aces_daily, package = "JWileymisc")

  data = aces_daily)

R2(m1)
R2(m1, cluster = TRUE)

hist(R2(m1, cluster = TRUE)$R2)
